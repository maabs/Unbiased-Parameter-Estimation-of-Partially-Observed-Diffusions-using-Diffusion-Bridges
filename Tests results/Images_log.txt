In this document I summarize the files necessary to obtain the plots of the preprint:


Logistic_Cost_vs_MSE.pdf

This plot is obtained in bridge_test.py, data comes in two parts, a series of 30x39 files in the form Prl_Gen_Unbiased_pars_vGU7_ip_ij.txt (in the folder Observationsdata), where i \in {i, ii, ...,xxxviii,xxxix} and j \in {1,...,30}. Additionally, the computation times of these results are in the files of with the names test.id.j.out, where id spans 39 ids 

[39548488, 39548569, 39568214,  39568660,    39583719,    39597363,    39597398,\
         39620862,   39620825,  39624120,  39626149,39626155,39626161,39626168,39626174,\
         39636631,39636652,39636658,39639678,    39639682,    39639691,    39639693,39639696,\
          39639704,    39639709,    39682098,    39683540,    39683545,    39683598,\
          39683609,    39683627,    39683637,39683641,39683643,    39683658,    39683666,\
          39683672,    39683690,    39683701]. 

The latter files are in the folder bridge/displays. 

The connection between the ids and the files can be found in the file Bridge_parallelization.py, where the details of each run are stored (during the duration of the project multiple trials were implemented, Bridge_parallelization.py is a file with 88k lines where the order of the trials are stored chronologically.)

In Logistic_Cost_vs_MSE.pdf the considered MSE is the one for the diffusion parameter of the observations.

OU_Cost_vs_MSE.pdf

This plot is obtained in bridge_test.py, data comes in two parts, a series of 30x7 files in the form Prl_Unbiased_pars_v_ip_ij.txt (in the folder Observationsdata), where i \in {i, ii, ...,vi,vii} and j \in {1,...,30}. Additionally, the computation times of these results are in the files of with the names test.id.j.out, where id spans 7 ids 

ids=["37831923","37831949","37870285","37870318","37948382","37968427","37999267"]. 

The latter files are in the folder bridge/displays. 

The connection between the ids and the files can be found in the file Bridge_parallelization.py, where the details of each run are stored (during the duration of the project multiple trials were implemented, Bridge_parallelization.py is a file with 88k lines where the order of the trials are stored chronologically.)


In Logistic_Cost_vs_MSE.pdf the considered MSE is the one for the diffusion parameter.

Boxplot_error_Score_functiontheta_1,2,4.pdf and Boxplot_error_unb_estimatortheta_1,2,4.pdf

These plot can be obtained in Test.ipynb, closely related plots can be obtained in bridge_test.py. 
There are 4 types of data, two of them correspond to the backward estimation of 
the score function, one of them with a number of particles N=500 and N=10. The other two sets of data correspond to the Girsanov method, data is obtained with N=500 and N=10. To estimate the truth we use both the Girsanov method and the Backward method with 500 particles, we average both methods since these can have differences depending on the time discretization levels and others. 
The data files are: "Prl_Gen_C_SGD_bridge_pars_0_vGCSb_comparison_ix.txt" and "Prl_Gen_C_SGD_bridge_pars_0_vGCSb_comparison_viii.txt" for the backward method. This data can be replicated using the parameters in Bridge_parallelization.py 

The data for the Girsanov method can be found in matlab files: "X1_sm_31.txt" (and other similar files X2_sm..., Grads2_sm_... etc) and "X1_sm_31.txt". The files are generated by "Gir_matlab_new_truth.m" and "Gir_matlab_truth_low_par.m in the file "Girsanov approach matlab".

Logistic_Cost_vs_MSE_v2_theta(1-4).pdf

These plots are computed with the files  Prl_Gen_Unbiased_pars_vGU8_ip_i_j.txt, where i spans the roman number (lowercase) from i to xx and j goes from 1 to 30.

The true value of the parameters was computed by running a large number of single estimators for a large number of SA steps with a large time discretization level. This can be found in GSb_True_hf5_ip_iii.txt. Additionally to this, after a large number of SA steps we average the final points and then run the algorithm again having as starting guess the averaged points of the previous computation, this is done 3 times until an equilibrium is reached.
